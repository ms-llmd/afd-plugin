# End-to-End Tests

These tests validate DeepSeek-V2-Lite on real GPU or Ascend NPU hardware,
Qwen3 MoE on real GPU hardware, and Qwen3.6 MoE through the Qwen3.5/3.6
adapter family on real CUDA hardware.
Each default gate runs four scenarios:

- `baseline-graph`
- `afd-eager-2a2f`
- `afd-graph-2a2f`
- `afd-graph-dbo-2a2f`

Each scenario evaluates the first 7 GSM8K samples. If `AFD_E2E_DEVICES` is set,
that value is used as-is; otherwise the defaults are:

- `0,1,2,3` for the gate scenarios. The 2A2F AFD cases use the first two for
  Attention DP2/TP1 and the last two for FFN DP2/TP1/EP2; `baseline-graph`
  uses all four for DP4/TP1/EP4.
- The 2A1F local cases use the first two for Attention and the third for FFN.

Tests run sequentially and must not skip. Every GSM8K evaluation uses 8
few-shot examples and a 4096-token maximum model length.

See the [E2E testing design](../../docs/design/module/e2e_testing.md) before
adding a model or case.

## Run

Run from the repository root. The environment needs `vllm`, `pytest`,
`afd_plugin`, `lm_eval`, `datasets`, and `huggingface_hub`. NPU also needs
`torch_npu`.

The default model suites download/cache `openai/gsm8k` and their Hugging Face
model when the backend model env var is unset. Point `HF_HOME` at a persistent
cache if you want to reuse downloads across runs. Large-model profiles are an
exception: they require an explicit local model path and never download a
checkpoint.

GPU:

```bash
export HF_HOME=/path/to/huggingface
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=gpu
# Optional: export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
# Optional if the model is already local:
# export AFD_GPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/model
```

NPU:

```bash
export HF_HOME=/path/to/huggingface
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=npu
# Optional: export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
# Optional if the model is already local:
# export AFD_NPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/DeepSeek-V2-Lite
```

Then run the selected model suite:

```bash
# DeepSeek-V2-Lite gate scenarios
python -m pytest -q -s \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[baseline-graph]" \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-eager-2a2f]" \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-graph-2a2f]" \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-graph-dbo-2a2f]"

# Qwen3 MoE
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/qwen3_moe/test_qwen3_moe.py

# Qwen3.6 MoE (text-only CUDA lane)
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=gpu
export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
export AFD_GPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/qwen3_6/test_qwen3_6.py
```

Success means 4 passed and 0 skipped.

The repository CUDA E2E evidence for the Qwen3.5/3.6 adapter family uses
`Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`, vLLM V1, and the
`P2pNcclAFDConnector` on CUDA. Every scenario passes `--language-model-only`;
multimodal execution is not covered. `baseline-graph` uses native DP4/TP1/EP4
on four devices. The three AFD scenarios use synchronous 2A1F: Attention on
the first two devices and FFN on the third. The fourth device remains unused
by AFD scenarios. The suite uses the same GSM8K-7, eight-shot, 4096-token,
0.27 minimum exact-match gate as the other default suites. NPU, multimodal,
`compute_gate_on_attention=true`, pipeline-parallel, asynchronous, and
multi-node execution are not covered; quantization is unverified.

### Qwen3.5-122B large-model CUDA profile

`Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B` has a separate, manual hardware profile. It is not a
default PR or merge gate and never downloads the roughly 234 GiB checkpoint.
Running it requires an explicit opt-in, an existing model path, and exactly
eight unique CUDA device IDs:

```bash
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=gpu
export AFD_E2E_LARGE_MODEL=1
export AFD_GPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B
# First four: Native or AFD Attention. Last four: AFD FFN.
export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/qwen3_5/test_qwen3_5_122b.py
```

The two sequential cases are `baseline-eager` (native DP4/TP1/EP4 on the
first four devices) and `afd-eager-4a4f` (Attention DP4/TP1 on the first four,
FFN DP4/TP1/EP4 on the last four). Both use BF16, text-only vLLM V1, natural
routing, GSM8K-7 with eight-shot prompting, and a 4096-token model length.
The profile removes benchmark-only forced-routing variables from child server
environments. It also disables the optional FlashInfer sampler because vLLM
0.26.0 rejects Blackwell SM12 during that sampler's capability check; greedy
GSM8K does not require it. Graph, DBO, asynchronous, multi-node, and
multimodal coverage are out of scope; graph coverage remains excluded while
issue #261 is unresolved. Quantized coverage is provided by the FP8 profile
below.

### Qwen3.5-122B FP8 four-device CUDA profile

`Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-FP8` is the block-wise FP8 sibling of the profile
above. Halving the weights to roughly 119 GiB lets the same two topologies run
on **four** devices instead of eight, which is what makes 122B-class coverage
reachable on a single 4x80 GB node. It is likewise manual, never downloads the
checkpoint, and requires an explicit opt-in, an existing model path, and
exactly four unique CUDA device IDs:

```bash
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=gpu
export AFD_E2E_LARGE_MODEL=1
export AFD_GPU_E2E_FP8_MODEL=/path/to/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B-FP8
# First two: AFD Attention. Last two: AFD FFN. All four: native baseline.
export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/qwen3_5/test_qwen3_5_122b_fp8.py
```

The two sequential cases are `baseline-eager` (native DP4/TP1/EP4 across all
four devices) and `afd-eager-2a2f` (Attention DP2/TP1 on the first two, FFN
DP2/TP1/EP2 on the last two). Note the asymmetry: the baseline owns the whole
device list, while the AFD case splits it in half.

The checkpoint's `quantization_config` declares `[128, 128]` block FP8 with
dynamic activation scaling, so vLLM selects the FP8 loader from the checkpoint
and the profile does **not** pass `--quantization`. `--dtype=bfloat16` stays
correct: it is the activation dtype, not the weight dtype. Everything else
matches the BF16 profile — text-only vLLM V1, natural routing, GSM8K-7 with
eight-shot prompting, a 4096-token model length, cleared forced-routing
variables, and the FlashInfer sampler disabled for the same SM12 reason.

Two caveats when reading results. Block FP8 GEMM and grouped-GEMM take
SM90/SM100 kernel paths; elsewhere vLLM falls back to Triton, so treat this
profile as correctness coverage and do not compare its latency against the
BF16 profile. And a 7-sample GSM8K gate has 14-point resolution, so a run that
lands below the BF16 profile's score by one sample is expected quantization
drift, not a topology regression. Graph, DBO, asynchronous, multi-node,
per-tensor FP8, and multimodal coverage are out of scope.

### Local 2A1F cases

The 2 Attention + 1 FFN scenarios are local-only cases; CI gates do not run
them. They use the first two devices for Attention DP2/TP1 and the third for
FFN DP1/TP1/EP1, and run GSM8K-7.

```bash
python -m pytest -q -s \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-eager-2a1f]" \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-graph-2a1f]" \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py::test_deepseek_v2_lite[afd-graph-dbo-2a1f]"
```

### GPU ModelRunnerV2 evidence matrix

The GPU-only ModelRunnerV2 regression matrix contains six representative
scenarios:

- `afd-v2-eager-1a1f` and `afd-v2-graph-1a1f`
- `afd-v2-eager-dp2` and `afd-v2-graph-dp2`
- `afd-v2-eager-tp2` and `afd-v2-graph-tp2`

The 1A1F scenarios use two devices and are local-only. DP2 and TP2 use four
devices, split evenly between Attention and FFN, and run in the CI gate on
`l4_4`. These rows record hardware-tested coverage; they are not a production
topology allowlist. Other valid DP/TP topologies use the same AFD and native
vLLM topology contracts.

```bash
python -m pytest -q -s \
  "tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_deepseek_v2_lite.py" \
  -k 'afd-v2'
```

### Weekly GSM8K

The weekly pipeline runs the Qwen3 MoE and Qwen3.6 MoE suites (baseline,
eager, and graph scenarios; the DBO scenario is excluded pending the FFN
CUDA fault investigation from build 68) plus the DeepSeek-V2-Lite
`afd-graph-dbo-2a1f` scenario, all with the default GSM8K sample limit. To
reproduce locally:

```bash
# Qwen3 MoE (all four scenarios)
python -m pytest -q -s tests/e2e/models/qwen3_moe/test_qwen3_moe.py

# Qwen3.6 MoE (all four scenarios)
python -m pytest -q -s tests/e2e/models/qwen3_6/test_qwen3_6.py
```

For a full 1319-sample run, export `AFD_GSM8K_LIMIT=all` before invoking
pytest. Without `AFD_GSM8K_LIMIT`, each scenario evaluates the first 7
samples.

## Run with the Codex skill

The repository includes the [`run-e2e`](../../.agents/skills/run-e2e/SKILL.md)
skill. Open the repository in Codex and ask, for example:

```text
Use run-e2e to run the Qwen3 MoE GPU E2E tests with HF_HOME
/data/huggingface.
```

Provide `HF_HOME` and `AFD_E2E_BACKEND`. For default suites,
`AFD_E2E_DEVICES` is optional and the model path is optional when Hugging Face
download is available. The two Qwen3.5-122B profiles instead require the
explicit large-model variables documented above. The skill checks prerequisites, runs
the selected cases, and reports failures and process cleanup.

## NPU async CAM smoke test

This separate test still reads `AFD_E2E_DEVICES`. It uses four NPUs: the first
two for Attention TP=2, and the last two for FFN DP=2/TP=1. It sends one
prompt and requests 32 tokens. It does not run GSM8K.

```bash
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=npu
export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
export AFD_NPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/DeepSeek-V2-Lite
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_async_cam_npu.py
```

The CAM/CANN runtime and custom operators must already be installed. Missing
model configuration or a device list other than four unique IDs fails the
test.

## NPU async CAM ubatching test

This case runs the `afd-async-ubatch` scenario (`CAMAsyncAFDConnector` with
AFD-managed two-stage MoE token-split ubatching). It uses three NPUs: the first
two for Attention DP=1/TP=2, and the last one for FFN DP=1/TP=1. Unlike the
smoke test above, it reuses the shared runner's GSM8K path with batch size 2
(first 7 samples, 8-shot, sample-count and accuracy gates).

```bash
export AFD_E2E_BACKEND=npu
export AFD_E2E_DEVICES=0,1,2
export AFD_NPU_E2E_MODEL=/path/to/DeepSeek-V2-Lite
python -m pytest -q -s \
  tests/e2e/models/deepseek_v2_lite/test_async_cam_npu.py -k async_ubatch
```

The device count is derived from the scenario's Attention/FFN rank constants,
not hard-coded; `AFD_E2E_DEVICES` may supply any three unique NPU IDs. The
topology is fixed at 2A1F, with TP=2 on Attention as required by token split.

Prerequisites match the async CAM smoke test (CAM/CANN runtime and custom
operators), plus a reachable GSM8K dataset source — offline pods need a local
HF mirror (`HF_ENDPOINT`). Both async CAM tests configure a 4096 MB buffer only
for connector-owned HCCL groups and remove `HCCL_BUFFSIZE` from child process
environments so unrelated groups retain their normal defaults. See
[`docs/npu/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../../docs/npu/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
