name: run-vllm-bench-k8s
description: Use when the user asks to benchmark an AFD GPU recipe on Kubernetes/OpenShift with vllm bench serve (or the repo's tools/benchmarks/request_generator.sh) - measuring throughput, TTFT, TPOT, or ITL for a deployed recipe and producing a report for that run. Deploys via deploy-afd-k8s. Do not use for local (non-k8s) benchmarking, NPU recipes, or E2E correctness testing (see run-e2e).

# Benchmark an AFD recipe with `vllm bench serve`

Deploy a recipe, drive load against it with the repo's
[tools/benchmarks/request_generator.sh](../../../tools/benchmarks/request_generator.sh)
(a thin wrapper around `vllm bench serve`), and produce a self-contained
report for **that one run**.

One invocation = one run = one `RUN_ID` = one report.

## Scope

- GPU colocation recipes only -- whatever `deploy-afd-k8s` supports.
- Not for local benchmarking (run `request_generator.sh` directly against
  `decode_bench_server.sh` for that) or correctness E2E (`run-e2e`).
- Requires everything `deploy-afd-k8s` requires. No extra image: the bench
  pod runs `AFD_PLUGIN_IMAGE`, which already carries the repo at
  `/opt/afd-plugin` and vLLM's `bench` CLI.

## Workflow

### 1. Establish the run identity

```bash
RECIPE_SCRIPT_PATH=<local-recipe-script-path>
RUN_ID="$(basename "${RECIPE_SCRIPT_PATH}" .sh)-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
LOCAL_DIR="./reports/${RUN_ID}"
echo "RUN_ID=${RUN_ID}"
```

Every artifact is keyed on `RUN_ID`, which is what keeps one run's numbers
from being confused with another's.

### 2. Deploy the recipe

Follow **`deploy-afd-k8s`** with `RECIPE_SCRIPT_PATH`. It returns
`MODEL_ID`, `PVC_NAME`, `GPU_COUNT`, the serving node, the recipe's
`--max-num-batched-tokens`, and an endpoint at `http://vllm-service:18305`.

`vllm bench serve` is pointed at that endpoint with `HOST=vllm-service`
`PORT=18305`, and `MODEL_PATH=${MODEL_ID}` -- it must name exactly what the
pod serves, since the model id is sent in each request and used to load the
tokenizer.

### 3. Choose the workload

**If the user did not say what to run, ask before deploying anything.** Put
the question as a choice between the named workloads below, and say which
one you will use if they have no preference. Do not silently pick one -- the
workload *is* the result: a throughput number without its prompt shape and
offered load is not quotable.

Ask in this form:

> Which workload should I benchmark `<recipe>` with?
>   1. **balanced** (default) -- random 1024-token prompts, 256-token
>      outputs, Poisson arrivals swept 2 -> 16 req/s. General serving
>      behaviour and where latency starts to climb.
>   2. **max-throughput** -- same prompts, all requests issued at once,
>      concurrency swept 16 -> 128. The peak tokens/s this recipe can reach.
>   3. **prefix-heavy** -- 10 shared 256-token prefixes reused across
>      requests. Prefix-cache behaviour.
>   4. **long-context** -- 8192-token prompts, 256-token outputs. Prefill
>      cost on long inputs.
>   5. **smoke** -- 64 short requests, ~1 minute. Checks the wiring only;
>      never a published number.
>   Or give me your own ISL/OSL, rate and concurrency.

#### Built-in defaults

Each workload is a complete set of values -- adopt them as-is unless the
user overrides a specific knob. `SWEEP` is a list of `rate:concurrency`
points; `vllm bench serve` is **single-shot**, so each point is one separate
invocation of the wrapper (see step 4).

| Workload | `DATASET_NAME` | `INPUT_LEN` | `OUTPUT_LEN` | `NUM_PROMPTS` | `SWEEP` (`rate:conc`) | Extra flags |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **balanced** (default) | `random` | 1024 | 256 | 512 | `2:64 4:64 8:64 16:64` | -- |
| **max-throughput** | `random` | 1024 | 256 | 512 | `inf:16 inf:32 inf:64 inf:128` | -- |
| **prefix-heavy** | `prefix_repetition` | (unused) | (unused) | 512 | `2:64 4:64 8:64` | `--prefix-repetition-prefix-len 256 --prefix-repetition-suffix-len 256 --prefix-repetition-num-prefixes 10 --prefix-repetition-output-len 256` |
| **long-context** | `random` | 8192 | 256 | 256 | `1:32 2:32 4:32` | -- |
| **smoke** | `random` | 256 | 128 | 64 | `inf:8` | -- |

`REQUEST_RATE=inf` means "issue every request at time 0", so with
`MAX_CONCURRENCY` it is a closed-loop test measuring peak throughput. A
finite rate uses Poisson arrivals and measures behaviour under an offered
load, which is what latency SLOs care about. The two answer different
questions -- do not mix them in a single sweep.

`prefix_repetition` ignores `INPUT_LEN`/`OUTPUT_LEN` and takes its shape
from its own flags, which go in `EXTRA_ARGS`. It must **not** be given
`--dataset-path` (nor may `random`); vLLM rejects that combination.

#### Other datasets

`--dataset-name` also accepts `sharegpt`, `burstgpt`, `sonnet`, `hf`,
`custom`, and several multimodal variants. These need a real corpus, so pass
`--dataset-path <file-or-hf-id>` through `EXTRA_ARGS` and mount it into the
bench pod. Use one when the user asks for realistic traffic rather than
synthetic prompts; otherwise prefer `random`, whose ISL/OSL are exactly
controllable and therefore reproducible.

#### Sizing the sweep against the recipe

Match offered load to the recipe's `--max-num-batched-tokens` from step 2. A
recipe pinned at 64 absorbs a 1024-token prompt in ~16 chunked-prefill
steps, so a high rate puts it in permanent backpressure and the report
measures queueing rather than the recipe. Long-context makes this sharper:
an 8192-token prompt at that budget needs ~128 steps.

Sweep until at least one point saturates -- TTFT climbing, or `completed`
below `NUM_PROMPTS`. A sweep where nothing saturates measured headroom, not
capacity, and the report has to say so.

### 4. Run the sweep

The pod runs the AFD image, so the wrapper is already on disk at
`/opt/afd-plugin/tools/benchmarks/request_generator.sh`. Two details:

- The wrapper calls `uv run vllm bench serve`. The image's base Python
  environment is already correct, so a `uv` shim on `PATH` strips `uv run` --
  resolved before the shim is installed, since afterwards `command -v uv`
  would find the shim itself and recurse.
- `EXTRA_ARGS` adds `e2el` and p90. `vllm bench serve` defaults
  `--percentile-metrics` to `ttft,tpot,itl` (no `e2el`) and
  `--metric-percentiles` to `99` only, so without this the report cannot
  show end-to-end latency or p90.

Export the workload chosen in step 3 -- these are the `balanced` defaults:

```bash
DATASET_NAME=random
INPUT_LEN=1024
OUTPUT_LEN=256
NUM_PROMPTS=512
SWEEP="2:64 4:64 8:64 16:64"      # rate:concurrency

    - name: reports
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: vllm-bench-reports
EOF
```

The loop does not `set -e`: one failing sweep point records `rc=1` but the
remaining points still run, so a single bad rate does not discard the whole
sweep. The sentinel is written either way.

**If `MODEL_ID` is an in-container path** rather than a HF repo id (step 2),
`vllm bench serve` cannot load the tokenizer -- it resolves `--model` as a HF
repo id and fails with `HFValidationError: Repo id must be in the form ...`.
Mount the model PVC read-only at the same path and pin the pod to the
serving node (the PVC is `ReadWriteOnce`, so a second pod attaches only from
that node, otherwise `Multi-Attach error for volume ...` leaves it
`Pending`):

```yaml
  nodeName: ${VLLM_NODE}          # spec level
      volumeMounts:               # container level
        - name: model-storage
          mountPath: /models
          readOnly: true
  volumes:                        # spec level
    - name: model-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: ${PVC_NAME}
        readOnly: true
```

### 5. Wait for completion, then collect

The pod holds after the sweep, so completion is the sentinel file, not a
`Succeeded` phase -- which also preserves the exit code:

```bash
kubectl logs -f pod/vllm-bench 2>/dev/null || true

deadline=$(( $(date +%s) + 7200 ))
RC=""
while true; do
  phase="$(kubectl get pod vllm-bench -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}' 2>/dev/null || true)"
  case "$phase" in
    "")      echo "vllm-bench pod is gone"; exit 1 ;;
    Failed)  echo "vllm-bench Failed (OOM, or activeDeadlineSeconds hit)"
             kubectl describe pod vllm-bench | tail -20
             kubectl logs vllm-bench --tail=100; exit 1 ;;
  esac
  RC="$(kubectl exec vllm-bench -- cat "/reports/${RUN_ID}/.exit_code" 2>/dev/null || true)"
  [ -n "$RC" ] && break
  if [ "$(date +%s)" -ge "$deadline" ]; then
    echo "timed out after 2h waiting for the sweep (phase=${phase})"
    kubectl logs vllm-bench --tail=50; exit 1
  fi
  sleep 10
done

[ "$RC" = "0" ] || echo "at least one sweep point failed; the report must say which"
echo "=== sweep finished, exit=${RC} ==="

mkdir -p "${LOCAL_DIR}"
kubectl cp "vllm-bench:/reports/${RUN_ID}/." "${LOCAL_DIR}"
ls "${LOCAL_DIR}"

kubectl delete pod vllm-bench
```

Delete only **after** confirming the files are local -- that is the whole
reason the pod holds.

**If that pod is already gone** -- an interrupted run, or an earlier
`RUN_ID` -- reports remain on the `vllm-bench-reports` PVC. See
[references/fetching-past-reports.md](references/fetching-past-reports.md).

### 6. Record the run manifest

```bash
cat > "${LOCAL_DIR}/run.json" <<EOF
{
  "run_id": "${RUN_ID}",
  "harness": "vllm-bench-serve",
  "recipe": "${RECIPE_SCRIPT_PATH}",
  "model_id": "${MODEL_ID}",
  "image": "${AFD_PLUGIN_IMAGE}",
  "gpu_count": ${GPU_COUNT},
  "max_num_batched_tokens": <from deploy step 2>,
  "workload": "<balanced|max-throughput|prefix-heavy|long-context|smoke|custom>",
  "dataset": "${DATASET_NAME}",
  "workload_args": "${WORKLOAD_ARGS}",
  "input_len": ${INPUT_LEN},
  "output_len": ${OUTPUT_LEN},
  "num_prompts": ${NUM_PROMPTS},
  "sweep": "${SWEEP}",
  "node": "${VLLM_NODE}",
  "finished_utc": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
}
EOF
```

Recording the workload and sweep next to the numbers is what keeps the
report interpretable after the cluster is torn down, and lets
`comparing-runs.md` check that two runs are actually comparable.

### 7. Report this run

`${LOCAL_DIR}` holds one JSON per sweep point
(`rate_<rate>_conc_<conc>.json`). Each is a flat object -- no nesting -- with
the run envelope (`date`, `model_id`, `num_prompts`, `request_rate`,
`max_concurrency`, `label`) merged with the metrics.

**TTFT and TPOT are required in every report**: they separate prefill cost
from decode cost, and an AFD topology can move one without moving the other,
so end-to-end numbers alone hide the effect.

| Report as | Key in the result JSON | Means |
|---|---|---|
| **TTFT** | `mean_ttft_ms`, `median_ttft_ms`, `p90_ttft_ms`, `p99_ttft_ms` | Prefill + queue wait. Rises first under backpressure -- the earliest saturation signal. |
| **TPOT** | `mean_tpot_ms`, `p90_/p99_tpot_ms` | Decode cost per output token, excluding the first. |
| ITL | `mean_itl_ms`, `p90_/p99_itl_ms` | Measured gap between consecutive streamed tokens. Related to TPOT, not identical -- do not substitute one for the other. |
| E2EL | `mean_e2el_ms`, `p90_/p99_e2el_ms` | End-to-end per request. Present only because step 4 passes `e2el` in `--percentile-metrics`. |
| Throughput | `output_throughput`, `total_token_throughput`, `request_throughput` | tokens/s and req/s. |
| Completion | `completed` vs `num_prompts`, plus `failed` | Error/drop rate. |

All latency keys are **milliseconds** (the `_ms` suffix is literal); vLLM
reports throughput in tokens/s. State units once and stay consistent.

```
Run:      <RUN_ID>
Harness:  vllm bench serve (random ISL <n> / OSL <n>, <num_prompts> prompts/point)
Recipe:   <path>   (GPUs: <n>, max-num-batched-tokens: <n>)
Model:    <MODEL_ID>
Profile:  <name> -- sweep <rate:conc ...>

| Rate | Conc | Output tok/s | TTFT mean | TTFT p99 | TPOT mean | TPOT p99 | E2EL mean | Completed |
|------|------|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
```

Close with the saturation point -- the first sweep point where TTFT departs
from flat (it moves before end-to-end latency) or `completed` drops below
`num_prompts` -- and name any point that failed outright. If nothing
saturated, say so: the sweep measured headroom and the ceiling is above what
was offered.

### 8. Comparing several runs

See [references/comparing-runs.md](references/comparing-runs.md) --
confirming two runs are comparable, deriving the non-AFD baseline recipe to
compare against, and reporting per-point deltas.

### 9. Leave the cluster in a known state

`deploy-afd-k8s` leaves `vllm-pod`/`vllm-service` running on purpose so the
next run skips the model download and graph capture. Report what is still
up; do not delete unless asked:

```bash
kubectl delete pod vllm-bench --ignore-not-found   # already deleted in step 5 on the happy path
kubectl delete pod vllm-pod
kubectl delete svc vllm-service
```

Keep `vllm-bench-reports` until every run of interest has been copied out.
